            A restaurant that incorporates a liberal amount of greens and reds
            into the components of its menu is a surefire sign of one that cares
            about the health and calorie consumption of its consumers. Leaving a
            place like this means you wont leave with your pants feeling tighter
            and your waistline expanded
